# Sim_Replay

FS2020 -> Simconnect -> python -> a record

## Startup

At least *Python 3.10* version is necessary to use the app (yes there are **matches**, wouhou !)

To run the app, put the `SimConnect.dll` in the project folder and run `python main.py` at the same place, but you can also use a decent IDE.
